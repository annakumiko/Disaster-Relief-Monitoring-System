This is our entry to Google Solutions Challenge 2020

Disaster Response Monitoring System is a web app that aids disaster response teams to streamline its operations. We learned that in relief operations, data updates frequently. Itâ€™s a struggle for them to exchange frequently changing data via chat messages and release that data publicly in a consistent, and transparent manner. Our solution provides them a centralized platform to communicate, and track relief operations data within the team and to the public.
